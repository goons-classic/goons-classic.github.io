## Goons Field Guide

### About us
Goons are one of the first settlers on Earthshaker. The unbearable queues on Firemaw in the first 2 weeks of Classic resulted in us having to make a new start on a fresh server. Vanilla classic has come to an end, and it has been a crazy ride for us and one hell of a journey. We managed to clear all the content, and had a lot of fun doing it. Now our focus will be do to the same for TBC.

### Guild Structure
 - **Lyyna** -  Guild master  
 -  **Pingvin** - Raid leader / Guild bank  
 -  **Flippey** - Karazhan portals and Refreshment tables 
 -  **Zarkasm** -  He's a real nice guy. 

We use the following ranks, starting with the lowest rank:

     Social / Alt > Trial > Member > Raider > Veteran > Officer > Guild Master

Anyone who wants to raid with us will be given a trial period of about 2-4 weeks. Show us that you have a functioning brain and you won't have much to worry about.

### Raiding schedule

Official raid days are **Thursday and Sunday 20:00 – 23:00 ST.** We expect our raiders to be available for both days. 
Additionally we will do some optional raids on other days if there is enough interest.

Check the guild message of the day in-game for whom to whisper for invite. It is important that you only whisper “inv” because we use auto-invite. Please try to be in the raid 19.50 at the latest.

### Signing up for raids

We use a discord bot to manage raid signups. We will post events in the designated channels:

    #thursday-signup, #sunday-signup or #off-raid-signup

-   Click your class / spec icon on the event to sign up.
-     
-   If you are unable to attend the raid, please click on Absence/Tentative/Late (depending on your situation). 
    
-   If you haven’t signed up to the raid, but still show up, we may be inclined to replace you for someone who has signed up.
    

### Preparation
- For the first phase there will be no strict consumable requirements, but everyone is encouraged to use the correct consumables for their class.
- In phase 2 + consumables will be required for the the "main" roster.
- Read up on tactics for bosses you are unfamiliar with.


### Loot
All loot will be distributed by the loot council. Our focus will be on distributing loot equitably; equally based on attendance, merit, and quality of the upgrade.
