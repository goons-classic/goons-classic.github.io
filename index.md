## Goons Field Guide

### About us
Goons are one of the first settlers on Earthshaker. The unbearable queues on Firemaw in the first 2 weeks of Classic resulted in us having to make a new start on a fresh server. Vanilla classic has come to an end, and it has been a crazy ride for us and one hell of a journey. We managed to clear all the content, and had a lot of fun doing it. Now our focus will be do to do the same for TBC.

### Guild Structure
The guild is managed by:

 - **Lyyna** -  Guild master  
 -  **Pingvin** - Raid leader / Guild bank  
 -  **Flippey** - Karazhan portals and Refreshment tables 
 -  **Zarkasm** -  He's a real nice guy. 

We use the following ranks, starting with the lowest rank:

     Social / Alt > Trial > Member > Raider > Veteran > Officer > Guild Master

The Veteran role is for ex-officers whom have chosen to step down. We still value their opinion so we give them an elevated position so they can keep in the loop in Officer chat.

### Raiding schedule

Official raid days are **Thursday and Sunday 20:00 – 23:00 ST.** We expect our raiders to be available for both days. 
Additionally we will do some optional raids on other days if there is enough interest.

Check the guild message of the day in-game for whom to whisper for invite. It is important that you only whisper “inv” because we use auto-invite. Please try to be in the raid 19.50 at the latest, unless otherwise announced on Discord.

### Signing up for raids

We use a discord bot to manage raid signups. We will post events in the designated channels:

    #thursday-signup, #sunday-signup or #off-raid-signup

-   Click your class icon on the event to sign up.
-   If this is your first time, the raid-helper bot will send you a DM asking for your spec.
-   If you are unable to attend the raid, please click on Absence/Tentative/Late (depending on your situation).     
-   If you haven’t signed up to the raid, but still show up, we may be inclined to replace you for someone who has signed up.
    

### Preparation
- For the first phase there will be no strict consumable requirements, but everyone is encouraged to use the correct consumables for their class. [See this link](https://tbc.wowhead.com/guides/raid-consumables-flasks-elixirs-potions-wow-burning-crusade-classic)
- In phase 2 + consumables will be required for the the "main" roster.
- Read up on tactics for bosses you are unfamiliar with.


### Loot
In phase 1 we will be very laissez-faire with loot, and only use SR for 25 man raids.
After phase 1, for the "main" roster atleast, all loot will be distributed by the loot council. Our focus will be on distributing loot equitably; equally based on attendance, merit, and quality of the upgrade.
